# pyblog.me
I made a Python Blog using Flask.
This project uses the Flask extensions; Flask-Mail, Flask-Login, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-WTF, and FlaskSQLAlchemy to operate most of 
the website. I modeled a database. I learned too make queries, use validators, and make configurations within an app. I implemented blueprints and templates too 
aid with the organization of the code. I implemented environment variables to keep important data private.
